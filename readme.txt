Hello and welcome to the repository showcasing the narrative graphs created for the CPSS conference! 


All graphs are created over 96 posts that were found to belong to a topic related to national and ethnic identity. I decided not to include the names of the channels in this depository, so instead, I numbered them.


The typology of the channels is as following (numbers correspond to the numbers in the file names):


1. an Italian-language channel diffusing ‘alternative news’. They have often been accused of spreading misinformation by fact-checkers. Some of their posts hint at conspiracies and a rather far-right narrative.
2. an Italian-language channel spreading seemingly mainstream news with no strong political leaning, but it is not clear who is behind it
3. a far-right channel with conspiracist and nazist sympathies posting mainly in English, but occasionally also in Spanish, from a Spanish creator.
4. a Dutch-language radical right channel with conspiracist tendencies
5. the official Telegram channel of one of the largest Dutch mainstream news outlets
6. the official Telegram channel of a large mainstream news outlet from the UK
7. a Dutch-language channel spreading QAnon-adjacent conspiracy theories
